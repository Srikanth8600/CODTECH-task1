**Showcase Technical Skills:**
    Demonstrate proficiency in web development, design, and backend integration, making it a valuable addition to your portfolio.

**Understand Project Workflow:**
    Plan, design, and implement a full-stack project from scratch, preparing for real-world development scenarios.

###  key Activities:

**1. Planning and Design:**
      Define the purpose and goals of the portfolio website.
      Sketch a wireframe or mockup for the layout and structure of the website.
      Choose a color scheme, typography, and design elements to ensure an attractive visual style.

      Deploy the backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
      Set up a custom domain if available.

**7. Documentation**
      Write clear documentation for the project, including:
      Features and functionality.
      Setup and deployment instructions.
      Technology stack used.
      Document the codebase with comments and maintain a README file.
